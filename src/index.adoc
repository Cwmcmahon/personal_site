My name is Carter McMahon, and I go by Cartoon Macaroni or cartoonmac in a lot of online spaces.

This is my website! It'll always be a work-in-progress, and I'll update it whenever I think it needs updating. xref:about/index.adoc[_About_] has more information about this website and its pages.

Here's an alphabetical list of some of my interests:

* 3D printing
* Board games
* Hiking
* Reading
* Self-hosting
* Video games

I expand a bit on these on my xref:now/index.adoc[_Now_] page!
