== Pages

xref:../blog/index.adoc[_Blog_] is, unsurprisingly, my blog. I'm not sure how often I'll write posts for it, but that's where they will go.

xref:../commonplace/index.adoc[_Commonplace_] is where I gather quotes that I like, and it's inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book[commonplace books].

xref:../now/index.adoc[_Now_] describes what I'm currently focused on, and it's based on https://nownownow.com/about[this idea] from https://sive.rs[Derek Sivers]. 

== Open Source

This website is open source, so feel free to take a look at the https://github.com/Cwmcmahon/personal_site/tree/main[repo on GitHub]! I wrote a ruby script that generates the html files from https://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] files using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
